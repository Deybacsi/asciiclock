# ASCII clock 

My C++ experiment to display the time in a nonregular retro [demo looking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) style.

ASCII art is cool, but a living ASCII clock is much more cooler if you place it in your kitchen/bedroom/mancave!

## Install & compile

You'll need a linux console and a C++ compiler. No. It will not run on Windows.
(It can run on Windows Subsystem for Linux, or in a virtual machine)

```
git clone https://github.com/Deybacsi/asciiclock.git
cd asciiclock
./run.sh
```

Or you can compile it manually, if it's easier for you :) 

## Extras

Currently it has:

* Digital clock display (analog is in progress)
* 3 character sets for digital clock
* 5 background effects (snow, starfield, fire, matrix, plasma)
* 1 foreground effect (a rotating 3D cube)

You can quit with pressing the `x` or `q` keys. Foreground effect(s) can be toggled with `f`.

A small fancy video is available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/-2mY1qRn23I) about this whole thing :)
